- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @official-anato
- I like learning about science, technology, and coding, my dream is to become a game dev one day, but coming from where i live, it might be hard.
- currently, i am learning python, i can code in it and i understand the syntax, but there might be keywords, functions, or other things i might not understand.
- if you have a question, feel free to contact me on discord: @official_anato
- i personally don't care, but nowadays it's everywhere - my pronouns are he/him.
